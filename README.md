# RPG-Concept
This is an ongoing project of an RPG Concept created from ideas for a hypothetical RPG/MMORPG. 

~The project utilizes a Header File and Class to create a Player Character by allowing 
the player to create a Name, choose the Character Class based off of chosen Weapon Archetype,
choose a Character Race, and finally their weapon(s), Armor, Bracer, Leg Armor, and accessory in the form of a Tattoo

~The Character Stats consist of Level, Job Level, HP, SP, Strength, Agility, Vitality, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Luck.
Each are randomized within a certain range depending on the class. 

~The player starts out with 11 Classes to choose from:

Renegade(Thief class; Able to copy one skill from another Character Class with Gank Skill)
Warrior(Swordsman class)
EnergyMaster(Offensive Magic User)
Sage(Healer and Defensive Magic User)
Ravager(Berserker Class)
BulletShark(Gunslinger Class)
Assassin(Stealth, Gradual Damage via Poison, and Damage Per Second class)
Artisan(Merchant class)
Guardian(Physical Defensive Class)
Hunter(Archer Class)
Breaker(Monk/Martial Arts Class)

ClassDepending on the Class, the character will be able to Dual-Wield. 

Currently, the Renegade (two Daggers), EnergyMaster(two Bracelets or two Grimoires or a mix of both), 
Ravager(two Axes), Assassin(two Claws), and Sage(Staff and Shield) can Dual Wield

The chosen Class is determined by the chose Weapon Archetypes:

Sword(Warrior and Artisan)
Daggers(Renegade)
Gauntlets(Breaker)
Guns(BulletShark)
Bracelet(EnergyMaster)
Staves(Sage)
BowAndArrow or CrossBow(Hunter)
GreatSword or SwordAndShield(Guardian)
Axes(Ravager)
Claws(Assassin)

For the Hunter Class, choosing the BowAndArrow archetype gives a bonus to the Agility stat; 
choosing CrossBow gives bonus to Dexterity

For Guardian class, choosing the SwordAndShield archetype gives a bonus to the Strength stat;
choosing the GreatSword gives bonus to Vitality

Each class have their lists of Armor, Bracer, Leg Armor, and Tattoo with some classes sharing equipment.

If character is able to Elevate to next Class, two optional Branches are presented for the player to choose the next Class

Currently the list of the weapons and all equipments go up to 36. In terms of quantity and Levels. 
Some of the Levels are floating-point Levels. Weapons and Equipment with those types of levels alter Stats multiplicatively
and may have more bonuses to Stats. 

Any additional help, input, or advice is well appreciated.
